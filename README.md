# Changiz-Git  

## Overview  
Changiz-Git is a lightweight version control system implemented in C, inspired by Git.  
It provides essential functionality for managing repositories, tracking changes, and supporting branching workflows.  
This project was developed as a **first-year university project** to gain a deeper understanding of version control concepts and system-level programming.  

## Supported Commands  
- **init** – Initialize a new repository  
- **config** – Configure repository settings  
- **commit** – Record changes to the repository  
- **branch** – Create and manage branches  
- **checkout** – Switch between branches or commits  
- **revert** – Revert changes in the working directory  
- **reset** – Reset the repository state  

## Purpose  
The goal of this project was to re-implement core Git functionality from scratch in C, helping students explore how version control systems work internally.
